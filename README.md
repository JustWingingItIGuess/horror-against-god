good luck reading the code

an excersize[sic] of thinking outside the box.

Most code compilers will give you the red squiggly lines, but it runs anyway. You know why? THe power of determination, according to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

Be like the bee. 

Care not for what they think or say, persevere in defiance of the will of god, be patient and stay determined and you will prevail.
